MoveMania: The Adventure in Every Step!

During the crucial years of childhood, feeling connected, receiving support, and forging new friendships are vital for a child's happiness and overall development. The sense of unity and shared spirit among classmates plays a significant role in this journey. To foster this, we proudly introduce MoveMania!

MoveMania is an exciting game designed to boost the well-being of school-age children by promoting physical activity and community spirit. More than just a game, it inspires adventure, teamwork, and being active among kids.

How MoveMania Makes Magic:
- Team if formed for the class
- Exploration and Rewards: As kids walk, they unlock new adventures and collect treasures like coins and diamonds.
- Celebrate Achievements: Completing levels unlocks special moments where players can appreciate their classmates with unique compliment badges. For instance, award a badge to a classmate who shines as an artist.
- Team Power: Walking together multiplies the fun! When the group walks in unison, they activate a 'boost' feature, making it easier and faster to find rewards and complete levels. This shared activity not only adds excitement but also promotes team spirit.

MoveMania is more than a game; itâ€™s a shared journey of discovery and joy. Every step taken not only brings fun and excitement but also strengthens the ties that bind us, building a stronger, more connected community. Join the MoveMania adventure, where every step counts towards a happier, healthier community!


## Technical solution

Current solution is created with React Native and it utilizes GPS coordinate data from the user's phone. Application is not limited to mobile device usage only and can be extended with other wearables that are able to deliver movement data.

Key features of our Solution:
- Flexible Reward System: Effortlessly modify reward types and probabilities via the main app's configuration settings, without the need to alter the underlying reward engine.
- H3 Library: Our solution employs the H3 library to overlay sophisticated tile logic onto standard maps.
- Creative Progress Bar: It's designed to take movement data and achieved rewards as it's input to allow more flexbile gamification opportunities.

Our demo solution has no backend. To run app successfully in a real scenario backend is needed to store user related data and communicate coordinates between the users.
